# 🧠 Bank Transaction Fraud Detection Using K-Means Clustering

This project aims to **detect potential fraudulent banking transactions** by analyzing customer behavioral patterns using **unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)**.  
The study focuses on how transaction frequency, amount, and behavioral signals (such as login attempts) can indicate unusual or high-risk activity.

| `TransactionAmount` | Value of the transaction (currency-normalized) |
| `TransactionDate` | Date and time of the transaction |
| `TransactionType` | Type of transaction: Credit or Debit |
| `Location` | City where the transaction occurred |
| `DeviceID` | Device used for the transaction |
| `IP Address` | IPv4 address used during the transaction |
| `MerchantID` | Unique merchant identifier |
| `AccountBalance` | Account balance after the transaction |
| `PreviousTransactionDate` | Timestamp of the previous transaction |
| `Channel` | Channel used: Online, ATM, or Branch |
| `CustomerAge` | Customer’s age |
| `CustomerOccupation` | Customer’s occupation (e.g., Doctor, Engineer, Student, Retired) |
| `TransactionDuration` | Duration of the transaction (in seconds) |
| `LoginAttempts` | Number of login attempts before the transaction |

## 🧠 01. Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to understand relationships and behavioral distributions among customers.

### Key Visualizations:
1. **Correlation Heatmap** between numerical features  
   → Helped identify dependencies between transaction amount, balance, and login behavior.  
   ![Correlation Heatmap](assets/eda_correlation.png)

2. **Scatter Plot** showing 4 account behavior classes based on transaction frequency and amount  
    Q1: High Frequency & High Amount
    Q2: Low Frequency & High Amount
    Q3: Low Frequency & Low Amount
    Q4: High Frequency & Low Amount

3. **Pie Chart** of Account Class Distribution  
    → Displays the proportion of accounts in each behavioral class.

## 🧹 02. Data Cleaning and Processing

Data preprocessing ensured consistency and readiness for clustering.

### Main Steps:
- **Handling Missing & Duplicated Values**  
- **Feature Scaling** for numerical features  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables** (TransactionType, Channel, etc.)  
- **Outlier Handling** using `quantile_winsorize_series`  
- **Feature Binning** for:
- `TransactionAmount` → `TransactionAmountBin`
- `LoginAttempts` → `LoginAttemptsBin`
- **Exported** final processed dataset as `data.parquet`

## ⚙️ 03. Model Clustering

K-Means clustering was used to detect patterns and potential anomalies in transaction behavior.

### 1. **K-Elbow Visualization**
- Evaluated optimal cluster count (`K = 5`) with distortion score = **181.570**

![K-Elbow Curve](assets/elbow_curve.png)

### 2. **Silhouette Score**
- Achieved a **silhouette score = 0.7439**, indicating strong separation among clusters.

### 3. **Cluster Analysis**
- Used features:
- `TransactionAmountBin`
- `LoginAttemptsBin`
- `TransactionCountTotal`

### 4. **Model Saving**
- Saved models:
- `model_cluster.h5`
- `PCA_model_clustering.h5`

## 🔍 PCA Visualization

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied (`n_components = 2`) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

| Component | Example Value |
|------------|----------------|
| PCA1 | -0.295447 |
| PCA2 | 0.018164 |

## 🧩 Cluster Interpretation

| Cluster | Behavior Summary |
|----------|------------------|
| **Cluster 0** | Moderate transaction behavior across all metrics |
| **Cluster 1** | Stable users with balanced activity |
| **Cluster 2** | High login attempts → potential fraud pattern |
| **Cluster 3** | Low transaction amount and frequency |
| **Cluster 4** | High-value transactions — possible premium or risky customers |

![Cluster Distribution](assets/cluster_distribution.png)

## 📊 Insights

- Customers with **high login attempts** and **low transaction history** tend to cluster together — potentially indicating suspicious activity.
- **PCA-based visualization** strengthens interpretability, revealing distinct cluster boundaries.
- The methodology can serve as a **foundation for anomaly detection or supervised fraud prediction** in future extensions.
